    "In preceding notebooks, performed preliminary assessments of data quality and refined the question to be answered. You found a small number of data values that gave clear choices about whether to replace values or drop a whole row. You determined that predicting the adult weekend ticket price was your primary aim. You threw away records with missing price data, but not before making the most of the other available data to look for any patterns between the states. You didn't see any and decided to treat all states equally; the state label didn't seem to be particularly useful.\n",

    "In this notebook you'll start to build machine learning models. Before even starting with learning a machine learning model, however, start by considering how useful the mean value is as a predictor. This is more than just a pedagogical device. You never want to go to stakeholders with a machine learning model only to have the CEO point out that it performs worse than just guessing the average! Your first model is a baseline performance comparitor for any subsequent model. You then build up the process of efficiently and robustly creating and assessing models against it. The development we lay out may be little slower than in the real world, but this step of the capstone is definitely more than just instructional. It is good practice to build up an understanding that the machine learning pipelines you build work as expected. You can validate steps with your own functions for checking expected equivalence between, say, pandas and sklearn implementations."

    "So far, you've treated ski resort data as a single entity. In machine learning, when you train your model on all of your data, you end up with no data set aside to evaluate model performance. You could keep making more and more complex models that fit the data better and better and not realise you were overfitting to that one set of samples. By partitioning the data into training and testing splits, without letting a model (or missing-value imputation) learn anything about the test split, you have a somewhat independent assessment of how your model might perform in the future. An often overlooked subtlety here is that people all too frequently use the test set to assess model performance _and then compare multiple models to pick the best_. This means their overall model selection process is  fitting to one specific data set, now the test split. You could keep going, trying to get better and better performance on that one data set, but that's  where cross-validation becomes especially useful. While training models, a test split is very useful as a final check on expected future performance."

If you continue this way you'll end up with a model works well on the particular quirks of our test set _but fails to generalize to new data_.

    "These results suggest that vertical drop is your biggest positive feature. This makes intuitive sense and is consistent with what you saw during the EDA work. Also, you see the area covered by snow making equipment is a strong positive as well. People like guaranteed skiing! The skiable terrain area is negatively associated with ticket price! This seems odd. People will pay less for larger resorts? There could be all manner of reasons for this. It could be  an effect whereby larger resorts can host more visitors at any one time and so can charge less per ticket. As has been mentioned previously, the data are missing information about visitor numbers. Bear in mind,  the coefficient for skiable terrain is negative _for this model_. For example, if you kept the total number of chairs and fastQuads constant, but increased the skiable terrain extent, you might imagine the resort is worse off because the chairlift capacity is stretched thinner."

Then highlight that you built a linear model and the features that found. Comment on the estimate of its performance from cross-validation and whether its performance on the test split was consistent with this estimate. Also highlight that a random forest regressor was tried, what preprocessing steps were found to be best, and again what its estimated performance via cross-validation was and whether its performance on the test set was consistent with that. State which model you have decided to use going forwards and why. This summary should provide a quick overview for someone wanting to know quickly why the given model was chosen for the next part of the business problem to help guide important business decisions."

    "**A: 1** Before creating any models, we first calculated the mean as a predictor.  The resulting average price across our data set was $63.81. We then calculated the mean squared error to test the effectiveness of using\n",

    "We started with using a linear model while imputing missing values;  first, with the median and then with the mean.  Using linear regression for both data sets (imputed missing values with median and imputed missing values with mean) and found there to be very little difference between the two.  Both produced an MSE of around $9.00.  Thus we now know that either of these methodologies would produce a better result than just using the mean as a predictor.  Also, we noted significantly lower values for our test sets vs our train sets (for both median and mean) which suggests that we are overfitting. This was understandable given that we were leveraging a large number of features in our linear model.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "We attempted to refine the linear model using the SelectKBest method in sklearn.  However, the variance between our train data and test data was even worse that our simple linear regression model.  After attempting several different k values, we moved on to cross-validation.  Next we leveraged sklearn to identify the best number of parameters to use.  Resulting in a value of 8, and determined that our most impactful features in order of importance for our dataset are:\r\n",
    "Vertical drop, Snow Making, total_chairs, fastQuads, Runs, LongestRun_mi, trams, skiableTerrain_ac.  Vertical drop was our biggest positive feature.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Next we built a random forest model.  We leveraged preprocessing steps of imputing missing values using the mean & median and scaling the data.  We found that imputing missing values was more successful than scaling and imputing missing values with the mean.  The random forest model also provides us with a top four features list including fastQuads, Runs, Snow Making, and Vertical drop.  \r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Lastly, we evaluated the mean absolute error for the linear regression model and that of the random forest model for our data.  We found that the random forest model produces the lower cross-validation mean absolute rror dollars of 9.53  dollarsvs $10.50 for the linear regression model.  Therefore I would propose moving forward using the random forest model.  We also determined that our sample size is adequate and no further data needs to be collected.\r\n"
